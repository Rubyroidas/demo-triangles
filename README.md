# Triangles demo

A relay race challenge. You implement your portion of changes, append [Change log](CHANGELOG.md), modify the list below (write in your own nickname) and pass the project to someone else via fork.

You don't modify the project when it's been passed to someone else. Make sure you're done with all your stuff until saying someone to fork off of your repository.

Let's see how far this can go!

## Contributors (in the order of modification):

- [Rubyroidas](https://github.com/Rubyroidas) - deployed version is here: https://triangles-demo-rubyroidas.netlify.app/

## Tech stuff

Project is built on top of pixi.js with rollup. Simplicity is our everything. What matters - is your code impact.

If necessary - change bundler or graphics library. Demo - that is what's important!

Just

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

to start the project and dive into coding!
